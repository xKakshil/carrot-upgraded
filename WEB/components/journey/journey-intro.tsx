            I built Carrot Upgraded because repeating heavy rating math on every
            client made no sense. Instead of letting browsers compute official
            Codeforces rating deltas thousands of times, we compute once, store
            results, and serve instant JSON from a tiny backend. To optimize cost
            I used two student AWS accounts (each with $200 credits). I put two
            EC2 servers {"\u2014"} one on my friend{"'"}s student account and one
            on mine {"\u2014"} behind a load balancer so traffic distributes
            across both. Both servers connect to the same central MySQL and Redis
            for caching and locking. This setup gave us effective $400 in
            credits, improved availability, and kept costs almost zero while
            serving thousands of users.
